The SparkFun GNSS Timing Breakout - ZED-F9T (Qwiic) offers a unique entry into SparkFun&apos;s GNSS catalog featuring the ZED-F9T GNSS receiver from u-blox. The ZED-F9T provides up to 5 nanosecond timing accuracy under clear skies with no external GNSS correction. The ZED-F9T supports L1/L2 bands and operates on all major constellations concurrently so it is able to maintain its timing precision even if the module loses connection with on or more of the visible constellations.

The breakout includes a USB-C connector for primary power and communication, two Qwiic connectors for communicating over I<sup>2</sup>C using the SparkFun [Qwiic system](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic), three SMA connectors for the antenna and timing pulse signals as well as a host of PTH pins allowing direct interaction with most of the ZED-F9T's pinout. The board also includes an on-board rechargeable battery that provides power to the RTC on the ZED-F9T. This reduces the time-to-first fix from a cold start (~24s) to a hot start (~2s).
